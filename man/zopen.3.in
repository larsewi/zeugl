.SH DESCRIPTION
The @PACKAGE_NAME@ library provides atomic file operations through a transaction-based
interface. Files are modified by creating a temporary copy, modifying it, and
then atomically replacing the original file.
.SS zopen()
The
.BR zopen ()
function begins an atomic file transaction by returning a file descriptor to
a temporary copy of the file. The temporary file is always opened in read/write
mode. Upon calling
.BR zclose (),
you can choose whether to commit the transaction by replacing the original file
with the temporary file.
.PP
The
.I filename
argument specifies the file to start the transaction on. This file will be left
unmodified until the transaction is committed by a call to
.BR zclose ().
.PP
The
.I flags
argument can be zero or more of the following flags bitwise-ORed together:
.TP
.B Z_CREATE
If filename does not exist, create it as a regular file. This flag requires
the
.I mode
argument to be specified.
.TP
.B Z_APPEND
The file offset is positioned at the end of the file instead of at the start.
Unlike O_APPEND in
.BR open (2),
the file offset is not repositioned to the end before each write.
.TP
.B Z_TRUNCATE
The content of the original file is never copied into the temporary copy.
The temporary file starts empty.
.TP
.B Z_NOBLOCK
The function does not block on advisory locking (file locks) and will not retry
copying if it detects concurrent writes to the original file. In these cases,
the function returns an error with errno set to EBUSY. Note that this flag
does not guarantee the function won't block for other reasons.
.TP
.B Z_IMMUTABLE
Handle files with the immutable attribute. If the target file has the immutable
attribute set (using
.BR chattr (1)
on Linux or
.BR chflags (1)
on BSD), this flag allows the file to be modified by temporarily clearing the attribute.
.BR zopen ()
will temporarily clear the attribute before performing the atomic replacement,
then restore it on the new file. Without this flag, attempting to replace an
immutable file will fail with errno set to EPERM.
.IP
.B Warning:
The immutable bit toggling is not atomic. There is a brief window where the
file exists without the immutable attribute set.
.PP
The
.I mode
argument specifies the file mode bits to be applied when a new file is created.
If Z_CREATE is not specified, then mode is ignored and can be omitted. The mode
argument must be supplied if Z_CREATE is specified.
.SS zclose()
The
.BR zclose ()
function commits or aborts an atomic file transaction.
.PP
The
.I fd
argument is the file descriptor obtained from
.BR zopen (),
or \-1 for no operation.
.PP
The
.I commit
argument determines the action:
.IP \(bu 2
If
.BR true ,
the transaction is committed and the original file is atomically replaced
by the temporary file.
.IP \(bu 2
If
.BR false ,
the transaction is aborted and the temporary file is removed.
.PP
If multiple processes commit a file transaction simultaneously,
.BR zclose ()
guarantees that the original file is replaced exactly once by one of the
temporary files. Any remaining temporary files are deleted.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR zopen ()
returns a new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer).
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.PP
On success,
.BR zclose ()
returns zero. On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.BR zopen ()
and
.BR zclose ()
can fail with any of the errors specified for the underlying
.BR open (2),
.BR close (2),
.BR mkstemp (3),
and
.BR rename (2)
system calls.
.PP
Additionally,
.BR zopen ()
may fail with:
.TP
.B EBUSY
The Z_NOBLOCK flag was specified and either the file is locked by another
process or concurrent modification was detected.
.PP
.BR zclose ()
may additionally fail with:
.TP
.B EINVAL
The file descriptor was not obtained from
.BR zopen ().
.SH THREAD SAFETY
When compiled with pthread support, the @PACKAGE_NAME@ library is thread-safe.
Multiple threads can safely call
.BR zopen ()
and
.BR zclose ()
concurrently.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Between
.BR zopen ()
and
.BR zclose (),
you can use standard I/O operations such as
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR lseek (2),
.BR fstat (2),
etc., just as you would with a regular file descriptor.
.PP
The temporary files created by
.BR zopen ()
are automatically cleaned up if the process terminates unexpectedly
(via signal handlers installed by the library). Any already existing signal handlers before the first call to
.BR zopen ()
are chained.
.PP
There are measures to detect if another process is writing to the original
file while
.BR zopen ()
creates the temporary copy. However, this cannot be guaranteed unless
other processes modifying the file respect advisory locks (file locks).
Upon detecting concurrent writes,
.BR zopen ()
will continuously retry copying unless the Z_NOBLOCK flag is set.
.PP
The atomic rename operation requires that the temporary file and the
target file be on the same filesystem.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Simple atomic file write:
.PP
.nf
#include <zeugl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int fd = zopen("output.txt", Z_CREATE | Z_TRUNCATE, 0644);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("zopen");
        return 1;
    }

    const char *data = "Hello, atomic world!\\n";
    write(fd, data, strlen(data));

    if (zclose(fd, true) < 0) {
        perror("zclose");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
.fi
.PP
Appending to a file atomically:
.PP
.nf
#include <zeugl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

int fd = zopen("logfile.txt", Z_APPEND);
if (fd < 0) {
    perror("zopen");
    return 1;
}

const char *log_entry = "New log entry\\n";
write(fd, log_entry, strlen(log_entry));

zclose(fd, true);
.fi
.PP
Using Z_NOBLOCK to avoid blocking:
.PP
.nf
#include <zeugl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int fd = zopen("shared.txt", Z_NOBLOCK);
if (fd < 0) {
    if (errno == EBUSY) {
        printf("File is locked or being modified\\n");
    } else {
        perror("zopen");
    }
    return 1;
}

// Perform operations...

zclose(fd, true);
.fi
.PP
Handling immutable files:
.PP
.nf
#include <zeugl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

// File has immutable attribute set via: chattr +i protected.txt
int fd = zopen("protected.txt", Z_IMMUTABLE);
if (fd < 0) {
    perror("zopen");
    return 1;
}

const char *data = "Updated content\\n";
write(fd, data, strlen(data));

zclose(fd, true);  // Immutable bit is preserved
.fi
.PP
Aborting a transaction:
.PP
.nf
#include <zeugl.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int fd = zopen("important.txt", 0);
if (fd < 0) {
    perror("zopen");
    return 1;
}

// Perform some operations...
// Decide to abort the transaction
zclose(fd, false);  // Original file remains unchanged
.fi
