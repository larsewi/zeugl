.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a command-line tool for performing atomic file operations. It reads from an
input source (stdin by default) and writes to an output file atomically,
ensuring that the output file is never left in a partially-written state.
.PP
The tool uses temporary files and atomic rename operations to ensure that file
updates are atomic. This prevents data corruption and ensures that other
processes always see either the complete old version or the complete new version
of a file, never a partially-written state.
.PP
If there is a raise between two processes or threads, it's guaranteed that one
(and only one) process gets to replace the file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f " " \fIFILE\fR
Read input from \fIFILE\fR instead of standard input.
.TP
.BR \-c " " \fIMODE\fR
Create the output file with the specified octal \fIMODE\fR (e.g., 644).
If the file already exists, this option is ignored.
.TP
.BR \-a
Open the output file in append mode. Data will be added to the end of the file
rather than overwriting existing content.
.TP
.BR \-t
Truncate the output file. The file will be emptied before writing new data.
.TP
.BR \-d
Enable debug output. This will print detailed information about the atomic
operations being performed.
.TP
.BR \-v
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h
Display help message and exit.
.SH EXIT STATUS

.B 0
Success

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Copy a file atomically:
.PP
.nf
.RS
@PACKAGE_NAME@ -f input.txt output.txt
.RE
.fi
.PP
Write stdin to a file atomically:
.PP
.nf
.RS
echo "Hello, World!" | @PACKAGE_NAME@ output.txt
.RE
.fi
.PP
Append to a file atomically:
.PP
.nf
.RS
echo "New line" | @PACKAGE_NAME@ -a logfile.txt
.RE
.fi
.PP
Create a new file with specific permissions:
.PP
.nf
.RS
echo "content" | @PACKAGE_NAME@ -c 600 private.txt
.RE
.fi
.PP
Truncate and write to a file:
.PP
.nf
.RS
echo "replacement" | @PACKAGE_NAME@ -t existing.txt
.RE
.fi
.SH ATOMIC OPERATIONS
.PP
The @PACKAGE_NAME@ tool ensures atomicity by:
.IP 1. 3
Creating a temporary file in the same directory as the target file
.IP 2. 3
Writing all data to the temporary file
.IP 3. 3
Using atomic rename(2) to replace the target file
.IP 4. 3
Cleaning up the temporary file on error or interruption
.PP
This approach guarantees that readers of the target file will never see partial
writes, even if the writing process is interrupted or crashes.
